By default the whole database is selected.  By specifiing a part of the
database all the records below the selected part are logical added for processing.
If more than one slice is selected then they are added in the order you specify.
This is important because it can effect the default (first) parent.

The selection criteria is done by prefixing the request with a slash or =.

 /pattern
 =tid
 =title
 =T:title

The /pattern form searches both the title and the description for the pattern.
It adds only the matched items and doesn't include any children that are not actions

The = form adds all children under the specified criteria.

The =tid uses the tid (Task ID number) as the toplevel and adds all the children to the selection.

The =title takes the title and first searches case sensative then case insensative.

The last form =T:title  restricts the title search to only those with type 'T'
   (v,r,g,p) = Value/Vision, Role, Goal, Project
