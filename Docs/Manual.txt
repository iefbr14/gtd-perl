Colophon
========
This book is built using asciidoc

This document is an AsciiDoc multi-part book skeleton containing
briefly annotated element placeholders plus a couple of example index
entries and footnotes. Books are normally used to generate DocBook
markup and the preface, appendix, bibliography, glossary and index
section titles are significant ('specialsections').

NOTE: Multi-part books differ from all other AsciiDoc document formats
in that top level sections (dedication, preface, book parts,
appendices, bibliography, glossary, index) must be level zero headings
(not level one).
