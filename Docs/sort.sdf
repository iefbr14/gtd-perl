Sorting is the last stage of the prefiltering.  All reports support
sorting, but it doesn't make sense for some to sort by anything but
the reports default criteria.  For example the action reports group the
output by goal/project and will produce a less readable output if the
sort criteria is changed.

        tid          => by Task ID
        task,title   => by task title
        hier         => by full hierarchy title
        goal         => by hierachy from goal by title
        status       => by completed status
        priority     => by priority
        doitdate     => by doitdate,
        change       => by last update to item
        age          => by creation date
